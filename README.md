CPSC 501 - Assignment 1: Refactoring

The following code base is for Assignment 1 (refactoring assignment) offered in CPSC 501 by Jonathan Hudson at the University of Calgary.

The assignment description is as follows:
The focus of this assignment is the practical application of refactoring to some existing objectoriented code. Find or create a running program that is poorly structured and can be improved
by refactoring. Ideally, this will be code that you yourself have written in the past. This code
must have a minimal level of complexity. The project must consist of at least 5 classes that are
coupled together to make the program function, and there must contain an inheritance
structure consisting of multiple classes. 

Full assignment spec can be found here http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~hudsonj/CPSC501F19/CPSC501F19A1.pdf or in included in the repo as CPSC501F19A1.pdf

I've chosen to use the parking garage question used often as an object oriented design question. This version I will be refactoring includes several vehicle types, a parking garage, parking garage levels, parking spots, and entry/exit gates which handle distributing and collecting payment for parking tickets.
