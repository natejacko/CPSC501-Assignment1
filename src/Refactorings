Refactorings To Do:
1) Extract class (Bus) into Vehicle and extend (GIANT CHANGE) -> Could perhaps argue this as multiple changes (extract class, extract method, etc.)
2) Rename all the park methods to be more comprehensive of where you're parking
3) Long method in ParkingGarageLevel (park) - extract method
4) Replace the error checking (parking spot id == -1) with an exception
5) Add parking payments, on entry, pay on exit (ticket tracks entry and exit time and calculates a price)
 - Make it such that the calculated price is done in one method of the exit, where extracting it would be better
 

Perhaps:
1) Make the parking spot store a different enum that we do a switch against the vehicle types?
2) Add a truck/trailer class
 - Single spot vehicle and multi-spot vehicle super classes? Combine into one with a spots needed var
3) Add height to a parking garage
 - Add vehicle as an int in the vehicle class that we switch on to set height
